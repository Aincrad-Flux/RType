# NOTICE — Additional Terms for Epitech Projects

This repository is published under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)**.
The following additional terms and clarifications apply specifically to this repository and to its context as an Epitech student project.

---

## 1. Ownership and Intellectual Property

- The **subject, instructions, evaluation criteria, and any pedagogical material** provided by **Epitech** remain the **exclusive intellectual property of Epitech**.
  They are shared with students strictly for educational and academic purposes, and may not be redistributed, sublicensed, or reused outside of the school’s framework without Epitech’s prior consent.

- The **source code, implementation, documentation, and CI/CD workflows** present in this repository are the intellectual property of the **Aincrad-Flux organization** on GitHub.
  This codebase has been authored, maintained, and published by members of Aincrad-Flux in the context of academic work, and is licensed under the **GPLv3** for all uses outside the restrictions listed below.

---

## 2. Restrictions for Epitech Students

- Any student currently enrolled at **Epitech** (including all campuses, affiliates, or partner schools) is **strictly forbidden** from copying, reusing, or submitting the contents of this repository — whether in full or in part — as their own academic work.

- This restriction applies to:
  - Direct copy-paste of files or code fragments.
  - Submitting slightly modified versions of this code to bypass plagiarism detection.
  - Using this repository as the basis for a deliverable in an Epitech module, project, or evaluation.

- Such actions fall under **plagiarism** according to Epitech’s internal regulations and are considered a violation of academic integrity.
  Students caught engaging in this practice may face disciplinary sanctions from the school.

- The repository may, however, be **consulted for learning purposes only** (e.g. to read, understand, and study coding patterns or practices).
  Active reuse in academic submissions is explicitly disallowed.

---

## 3. Authorized Usage Outside Epitech

- Outside of the Epitech academic context, this repository is made available to the public under the terms of the **GNU GPLv3 license**.
  This means:
  - You may use, modify, and redistribute the code, provided that you comply with the conditions of the GPLv3.
  - Any derivative works must also remain licensed under the GPLv3.
  - Proper attribution to the Aincrad-Flux organization must be maintained.

- Contributions to this repository (pull requests, issues, patches) are welcome.
  By contributing, you agree that your work will also be distributed under the GPLv3 and remain subject to the additional terms outlined in this `NOTICE.md`.

---

## 4. Clarifications

- This `NOTICE.md` does not replace the GPLv3 license but **supplements it with contextual restrictions** related to Epitech’s academic integrity policies and the ownership division between Epitech and Aincrad-Flux.

- In case of conflict between the GPLv3 license and these additional terms, the **GPLv3 governs all general usage**, while the specific **Epitech-related restrictions apply only within the academic context**.
