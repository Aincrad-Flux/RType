# Quality & tooling

- Static analysis and quality: see `sonar-project.properties`
- Code style: follow project conventions; prefer small, focused changes
- Tests: add unit tests where feasible (engine systems, packet parsing)
- Performance: avoid allocations in hot loops; prefer contiguous storage for iteration
