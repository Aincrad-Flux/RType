## Programming Language

### C++20

**Choice:** C++20 standard

**Rationale:**
- **Performance:** C++ provides low-level control and zero-cost abstractions, essential for real-time game networking
- **Modern Features:** C++20 introduces concepts, ranges, coroutines, and modules that improve code quality
- **Industry Standard:** C++ is widely used in game development (Unreal Engine, Unity native plugins, game servers)
- **Memory Control:** Manual memory management allows fine-grained control over allocation patterns critical for networking

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Language | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Rust** | Memory safety, performance, modern | Learning curve, ecosystem for games less mature | Not chosen - C++ expertise available |
| **C** | Maximum control, minimal overhead | No modern abstractions, manual memory management | Not chosen - too low-level |
| **C#/Java** | Garbage collection, easier development | Runtime overhead, less control over memory | Not chosen - performance critical |
| **Go** | Simple concurrency, fast compilation | Garbage collection pauses, less game industry adoption | Not chosen - networking focus not enough |

**Conclusion:** C++20 provides the optimal balance between performance, control, and modern language features required for a networked game engine.

## Graphics Library

### raylib 5.5

**Choice:** raylib for client rendering

**Rationale:**
- **Simplicity:** Easy-to-use API, minimal setup required
- **Lightweight:** Small footprint, no heavy dependencies
- **Cross-platform:** Supports Linux, Windows (OpenGL-based)
- **Self-contained:** No external runtime dependencies
- **OpenGL Backend:** Direct OpenGL access when needed

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Library | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| **SDL2** | Very mature, cross-platform, low-level control | More boilerplate, larger API surface | Not chosen - raylib simpler |
| **SFML** | Modern C++ API, good documentation | Larger footprint, more dependencies | Not chosen - subject allows but raylib preferred |
| **OpenGL Direct** | Maximum control, no abstraction | Very verbose, requires more code | Not chosen - too low-level for project scope |
| **Allegro** | Game-focused, audio support | Less modern API, smaller community | Not chosen - raylib more modern |

**Conclusion:** raylib provides the perfect balance of simplicity and functionality for this project's rendering needs.

## Networking Library

### Asio (standalone) 1.28.0

**Choice:** Asio for asynchronous networking

**Rationale:**
- **Asynchronous I/O:** Non-blocking operations essential for multithreaded server
- **Cross-platform:** Works on Linux and Windows
- **Header-only Option:** Standalone version requires no linking
- **Proactor Pattern:** Efficient event-driven model
- **UDP/TCP Support:** Handles both protocols seamlessly

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **BSD Sockets Direct** | Full control, no dependencies | Platform-specific, verbose code | Not chosen - requires abstraction layer |
| **libuv** | Node.js proven, cross-platform | C API, less C++ idiomatic | Not chosen - Asio more C++ friendly |
| **Boost.Asio** | Same API, stable | Larger dependency, Boost required | Chosen standalone version instead |
| **ENet** | Game-focused, reliable UDP | Less flexible, smaller community | Not chosen - Asio more versatile |

**Conclusion:** Asio provides the best C++ networking solution with asynchronous capabilities required for the server architecture.

## Build System and Package Management

### CMake + Conan 2

**Choice:** CMake 3.20+ with Conan 2.x

**Rationale:**
- **Industry Standard:** CMake is the de facto standard for C++ projects
- **Cross-platform:** Works on Linux, Windows, macOS
- **Modern CMake:** Target-based approach (3.20+) provides better dependency management
- **Conan Integration:** Handles third-party dependencies cleanly
- **Reproducible Builds:** Conan ensures consistent dependency versions

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Build System | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------------|------|------|----------|
| **Meson** | Fast, modern syntax | Less widespread adoption | Not chosen - CMake more common |
| **Bazel** | Excellent scalability | Complex setup, overkill for project | Not chosen - too complex |
| **Make/autotools** | Universal, simple | Platform-specific code | Not chosen - CMake required by subject |

| Package Manager | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|------------------|------|------|----------|
| **Conan 2** | C++ focused, flexible recipes | Steeper learning curve | **Chosen** - Best for C++ |
| **Vcpkg** | Microsoft-backed, large catalog | Windows-focused initially | Not chosen - Conan more flexible |
| **CMake CPM** | Simple, no external tools | Limited recipe ecosystem | Not chosen - Conan more mature |
| **spack/hunter** | Scientific computing focused | Not game-oriented | Not chosen - Conan better fit |

**Conclusion:** CMake + Conan 2 provides the best combination of industry standards and modern dependency management.
