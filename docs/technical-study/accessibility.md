# Accessibility Analysis

This document describes accessibility features and considerations for the R-Type project, addressing the requirements for supporting players with disabilities.

## Overview

Accessibility in game development ensures that games are playable and enjoyable by people with various disabilities. While the current prototype has limited accessibility features, this document outlines existing considerations and recommended enhancements.

## Disability Categories

### 1. Physical and Motor Disabilities

**Definition:** Impairments affecting physical movement and motor control

**Challenges in R-Type:**
- Requires precise keyboard input (arrow keys)
- Fast reaction times needed
- Simultaneous key presses (e.g., movement + shooting)

#### Current Implementation

**Status:** ⚠️ **Limited Support**

- Fixed keyboard controls (arrow keys, space)
- No customizable key bindings
- No alternative input methods

#### Recommended Solutions

**A. Customizable Controls**
```cpp
struct InputMapping {
    KeyCode move_up = KEY_UP;
    KeyCode move_down = KEY_DOWN;
    KeyCode move_left = KEY_LEFT;
    KeyCode move_right = KEY_RIGHT;
    KeyCode shoot = KEY_SPACE;
};
```

**Implementation:**
- Allow players to remap all keys
- Support for single-hand operation
- Support for alternative input devices (gamepad, joystick)

**B. Reduced Input Requirements**
- Option for auto-shoot (continuous shooting without holding)
- Option for auto-movement (constant forward motion)
- Tap-to-move mode (click destination instead of holding keys)

**C. Input Sensitivity**
- Adjustable movement speed
- Input smoothing/dead zones for analog inputs
- Hold-to-repeat vs toggle modes

**D. Input Assistance**
- Assistive aiming (slight auto-aim)
- Reduced need for simultaneous inputs
- Alternative control schemes (mouse movement, touch)

### 2. Visual Disabilities

**Definition:** Impairments affecting vision, including blindness, low vision, color blindness

**Challenges in R-Type:**
- Visual feedback for all game state
- Color-based player identification
- Small sprites/details
- Fast-moving objects

#### Current Implementation

**Status:** ⚠️ **Limited Support**

- Color-coded players (0x55AAFFFF)
- Visual HUD only
- No audio cues for gameplay events

#### Recommended Solutions

**A. Audio Feedback**
```cpp
class AudioFeedback {
    void playEnemyNearby(float distance);
    void playPlayerHit();
    void playLowHealth();
    void playDirectionalSound(float x, float y); // Spatial audio
};
```

**Implementation:**
- Sound cues for enemy spawns
- Audio feedback for hits/damage
- Spatial audio for enemy positions
- Menu narration (screen reader support)

**B. High Contrast Mode**
- Option to increase contrast
- Outline all sprites with high-contrast borders
- Black/white mode option

**C. Color Blindness Support**
```cpp
enum ColorMode {
    NORMAL,
    PROTANOPIA,    // Red-green color blindness
    DEUTERANOPIA,  // Red-green color blindness
    TRITANOPIA     // Blue-yellow color blindness
};
```

**Implementation:**
- Alternative color schemes
- Pattern/texture-based differentiation (not just color)
- Player indicators (numbers, symbols in addition to color)

**D. Visual Scaling**
- Adjustable UI scale
- Larger sprites option
- Zoom functionality
- Reduce visual clutter option

**E. Screen Reader Support**
- Text-to-speech for menus
- Audio descriptions of game state
- HUD narration (e.g., "Health: 50%")

### 3. Hearing Disabilities

**Definition:** Impairments affecting hearing, including deafness and hard of hearing

**Challenges in R-Type:**
- Audio cues for gameplay
- Sound effects and music

#### Current Implementation

**Status:** ✅ **Good Support**

- Game is primarily visual
- No critical audio-only information

#### Recommended Solutions

**A. Visual Indicators for Audio Events**
- Visual notifications for sound events
- Subtitles for audio cues
- Vibration feedback (if supported)

**B. Audio Settings**
- Volume control (already standard)
- Visual-only mode option
- Disable non-essential audio

### 4. Cognitive and Mental Disabilities

**Definition:** Impairments affecting cognitive processing, attention, memory

**Challenges in R-Type:**
- Fast-paced gameplay
- Multiple simultaneous elements
- Complex controls
- Information overload

#### Current Implementation

**Status:** ⚠️ **Limited Support**

- Standard fast-paced gameplay
- No difficulty options
- Complex UI in some areas

#### Recommended Solutions

**A. Difficulty Options**
```cpp
struct DifficultySettings {
    float enemy_spawn_rate = 1.0f;      // 0.5 = half speed
    float enemy_movement_speed = 1.0f;  // Slower enemies
    float player_movement_speed = 1.0f;  // Adjustable player speed
    bool auto_shoot = false;             // Assisted shooting
    bool invincibility_mode = false;     // For learning/exploration
};
```

**Implementation:**
- Easy/Normal/Hard difficulty modes
- Customizable difficulty (sliders for various aspects)
- Practice mode (no death, infinite lives)
- Slow-motion mode option

**B. Information Simplification**
- Option to hide HUD elements
- Simplified UI mode
- Clear, large fonts
- Reduced visual effects

**C. Pause and Time Controls**
- Pause anytime (already standard)
- Slow-motion toggle
- Extended pause duration options
- Save state (for later continuation)

**D. Tutorial and Guidance**

## Integration with Comparative Study

Accessibility features affect technology choices:

### Impact on Graphics Library (raylib)

**Considerations:**
- raylib supports input remapping ✅
- raylib supports audio spatialization ✅
- raylib supports screen scaling ✅

**Conclusion:** raylib is well-suited for accessibility features

### Impact on Network Protocol

**Considerations:**
- Accessibility settings should be client-side (no network impact) ✅
- Assistive features (auto-aim) must be server-validated ⚠️

**Conclusion:** Most accessibility features can be client-only, reducing implementation complexity

### Impact on Game Engine (ECS)

**Considerations:**
- ECS architecture supports difficulty adjustments (component-based) ✅
- Easy to add/remove gameplay modifiers ✅

**Conclusion:** ECS architecture facilitates accessibility features

## Testing Recommendations

### Accessibility Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with keyboard-only navigation
- [ ] Test with screen reader
- [ ] Test color blindness simulators
- [ ] Test with reduced mobility (one-handed operation)
- [ ] Test with various input devices (gamepad, joystick, mouse)
- [ ] Test visual scaling at various levels
- [ ] Test audio-only gameplay (if applicable)
- [ ] Test with high contrast modes

### Tools

- **Color Blindness:** Color Oracle, Coblis simulators
- **Screen Reader:** NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (macOS), Orca (Linux)
- **Input Testing:** Keyboard/mouse alternatives, gamepad emulation
- **Visual Testing:** Magnification tools, contrast analyzers

## Conclusion

While the current prototype has **limited accessibility features**, the architecture supports adding comprehensive accessibility options. The recommended features can be implemented incrementally, starting with customizable controls and difficulty options, which provide the most immediate benefit.

**Key Principle:** Accessibility should be considered from the beginning of design, not added as an afterthought. The ECS architecture and modular design of R-Type facilitate adding accessibility features without major architectural changes.

**Future Work:**
1. Implement customizable key bindings
2. Add difficulty options
3. Implement audio feedback system
4. Add visual accessibility modes
5. Comprehensive accessibility testing
